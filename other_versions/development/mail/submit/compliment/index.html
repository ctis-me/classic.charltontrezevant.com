<h1>Submit your compliments!</h1>

<p>
<b>
Every once in a while, you come up with a compliment that's just <b>awesome</b>. <br />
Like, really, <i>really</i> awesome. <br />
And, you're all like "OMG THIS IS TEH BEST COMPLIMENT EVAR!!1!!1!11" And you smile, and are very pleased with yourself, and so on and so forth.
But, you can only share that joy, that pure euphoria that is produced by that fantastic compliment, with a relatively small number of people, and, sadly,  it never would get the sort of worldwide recognition that it deserves.
That is, until now.
Yes, now you can have your compliment immortalized on my Positive Wednesday page forever and for all to see! And at no cost to you! 
All you have to do is send your awesome compliments to <a style="text-decoration: none; color:#0000FF;" href="mailto:compliments@charltontrezevant.com">compliments@charltontrezevant.com</a>!
It's a fantastic way to send a warm, fuzzy feeling to people <i><b>all over the world!</b></i>
</b>
