Welcome!

You may be wondering why I, in my _apparently infinite professionalism_,  would host a website as weird as https://classic.charltontrezevant.com. 

This site was the product of my earliest forays into running web services, and I learned a great deal from it throughout my early teens. I keep it running on principle. 

Originally hosted on a Raspberry Pi gen1 in my cabinet, this site has been kept online through multiple iterations of my home server setup. It has survived several moves across closets, the nation, colocation, and cloud hosts. Now, it's been brought to rest here on GitHub Pages, with Backblaze B2 being used to serve media assets. 

I hope it gives you a laugh.
