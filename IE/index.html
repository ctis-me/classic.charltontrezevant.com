Keeping it as simple as possible to ensure compatibility with IE.
That means NO  CSS or media, and *lots* of "p" tags... (bleah)

<h2> A friendly message to Internet Explorer users. </h2>

<br />

<p>
So, you think you can come to my website and use Internet Explorer, huh?
</p>

<p>
Well, that's a <b> bad </b> decision you've made, friend. Especially if that decision was conscious.
</p>

<p>
Why subject yourself to all of this constant torture? The archaic, stone-age interface? 
</p>

<p>
The constant exploitation of security holes, which flood your beloved machine with viruses galore?
</p>

<p>
<b>How many times have you gotten a virus?
</p>
<p>
How many times have you sat patiently, for over 30 seconds, waiting for a web page to load?
</p>
<p>
How many toolbars that you never wanted are eclipsing this page right now?</b>
</p>
<p>
Do you find browsing the web a <i>pain?</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>When using Internet Explorer, all of the above are true.</b>
</p>

<p>
I used to be like you, too. Then, I got so tired of it, I forced myself to see the light.
Now, I'm spreading the gospel.
</p>

<p>
Internet Explorer is a browser that crushes the dreams of developers and users alike, and compared to 
browsers such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, it appears more as a neglected, cold, unforgiving 
utility than a powerful, elegant deliverer of the great variety of rich content that is so abundant on the modern web.
</p>

<p>
It's <span id="year"></span> and I think that it's time for you to use a secure, modern browser. Trust me, you'll love it.
</p>

<p>
Here are some links to powerful, secure, and extremely fast browsers that will never give you another headache again:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>
"Chrome is a fast, simple, and secure web browser, built for the modern web."
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a>
"The free, non-profit browser for desktop and mobile"
</p>

<p>
Check them out, see what suits you, give one of them a try.
</p>
<p>
And, who knows, maybe one day when IE isn't so horrible, I can finally take this page down.
</p>

<p>
You won't regret it.
</p>

<h3>Links, but most don't work in IE... :(</h3>
